### **Meaning of the Name**<br>
Serein is a rare French word that describes a gentle rain falling from a clear night sky, an ethereal phenomenon that carries an air of mystery and renewal. In the context of a framework for Unity, it embodies a symbolic transformation as the tangled mess of makeshift solutions mirrors the suffocating darkness of night, while the delicate rain of fresh vision descends unexpectedly, bringing clarity and a quiet revolution. As confusion dissipates, dawn inevitably arrives, revealing a path forward in a new light. Serein is not merely a nameâ€”it is a poetic metaphor for the journey from chaos to harmony, from outdated conventions to inspired innovation, from obscurity to lucidity.
